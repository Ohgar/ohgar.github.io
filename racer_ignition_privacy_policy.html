        This Privacy Policy governs the way in which Giant Cloud Studios LLC collects, uses, maintain, and discloses information collected from users (referred to as "Players") of the Racer Ignition mobile application (referred to as the "Game").

        Information Collection and Use
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>1. Third-Party Services</h2>
        Racer Ignition utilizes third-party services for advertising and leaderboard functionality. Please review the following sections for details on how these services handle user data:
        <h3>Advertising:</h3>
        Racer Ignition may include third-party advertisements, which may be displayed within the Game. These advertisements may collect certain non-personal identification information about Players, such as device information and location for the purpose of serving relevant ads. Players do not have the option to manage their ad preferences within the Game settings. We may use third-party advertising partners and networks to deliver these advertisements. These partners may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to provide personalized content and ads. Third-party ad service providers may have their own privacy policies governing how they handle user data. Players are encouraged to review the respective privacy policies of these ad service providers for more information.
        <h3>Danqzq Leaderboard:</h3>
        Racer Ignition features an online leaderboard system powered by the Danqzq leaderboard service, allowing Players to compare their scores with those of other Players. To provide this service, certain non-personal identification information, such as a Player's username and game scores, may be sent off-device and stored on the Danqzq servers. This leaderboard data is used solely for the purpose of ranking Players and enhancing the competitive aspect of the Game through the Danqzq leaderboard service. Danqzq may have its own privacy policy governing the data it collects and processes. Players are encouraged to review Danqzq's privacy policy for the information on how their data is handled by the leaderboard service. We take appropriate measures to secure the leaderboard data and protect it from unauthorized access or misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
        Racer Ignition offers an optional in-app purchase that allows Players to remove advertisements from the Game for a specified fee. This purchase is processed through the app store associated with the Player's device (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store). The payment process for in-app purchases is subject to the terms and condition of the respective app store. Please note that while the removal of ads is offered as an in-app purchase, other functionalities and features of the Game remain available to all Players regardless of whether they make this purchase. Giant Cloud Studios LLC does not collect or store payment information. All payment transactions are handled by the app store and are subject to their privacy policies and security measures.
        <h3>How We Protect Player Information</h3>
        We adopt appropriate data security practices and measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of player information within the Game. While Racer Ignition does not directly collect or store personal identification information, we are committed to safeguarding the non-personal identification information collected for the purposes such as advertising and leaderboard functionality. Our security measures are designed to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of player data, including but not limited to device information and gameplay data. We work diligently to ensure that any data shared with third-party service providers, such as advertising networks and leaderboard services, is handled securely in accordance with industry standards and best practices.
        Sharing Player Information
        We do not sell, trade, or rent Players' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding our Players with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
        Compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
        Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. We do not knowingly collect any personal identification information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided us with personal identification information without their consent, they should contact us immediately at [contact email address]. We will promptly remove such information from our records.
        Changes to this Privacy Policy
        We have the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Players to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Players acknowledge and agree that it is their responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.
        Player Acceptance of these Terms
        By using the Game, Players signify their acceptance of this policy. If Players do not agree to this policy, please do not use the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed as the Player's acceptance of those changes.
